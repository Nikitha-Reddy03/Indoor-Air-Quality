🏠 Indoor Air Quality Monitoring System (IoT Project)
This project is an IoT-based real-time air quality monitoring system designed to measure and display key indoor environmental parameters. It uses sensors and microcontrollers to help track temperature, humidity, and harmful gases like CO and smoke, making indoor spaces safer and healthier.

🚀 Features
📡 Real-time monitoring using ESP8266 Wi-Fi module

🌡️ Measures Temperature & Humidity using DHT11 sensor

🛑 Detects harmful gases using MQ-135 / MQ-2 sensor

📊 Displays data on 16x2 LCD display

☁️ Sends data to cloud platforms (e.g., ThingSpeak, Blynk)

🔔 Alert system for dangerous levels (via buzzer or notifications)
